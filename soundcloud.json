This album spans the course of a day until the point where night falls.\r\n\r\nThe first part, created by Aaron Martin, is a water-colour, cool and delicate. The twinkling sun reflected itself in a slow river, transparent silvery clouds sparkle and brush the heads of drowsy trees. The closer to the middle of the album, the lower goes the gentle shadow, saturating. In the second part - Christoph Berg’s one, water-colour turns into gouache. The sound becomes more full, more sensuous, it comes in waves, like breath of a sleeping man.\r\n\r\nJust close your eyes, be all ears and you’ll feel – the night is not silent. Sweet tune of twilight and darkness full of echo, humming blue, vague voice of the strings and clear gleaming of bright stars in a velvet sky – that is the night.\r\n\r\nIt’s a perfect and severely sincere work, slightly bittered with melancholy.\r\n\r\nAaron Martin is a very talented multi-instrumentalist from Topeka, Kansas who has releases on such labels as Experimedia, Preservation, Under The Spire, Sonic Meditations.\r\n\r\nChristoph Berg is composer and sound artist currently living and working in Berlin focusing on fragile acoustic chamber music compositions. Also writes electro-acoustic music as Field Rotation. He has releases on Facture, hibernate, Denovali Records, Fluid Audio.\r\n\r\nCurated by Bartosz Dziadosz (Pleq)\r\nCover painting \"Where The Sea Once Was\" by Richard Moult\r\nDesigned by Dronarivm Art","label_name":"Dronarivm","release":"DR-14","track_type":"original","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2013,"release_month":9,"release_day":23,"original_format":"wav","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106148636?secret_token=","user":{"id":1703766,"kind":"user","permalink":"dronarivm","username":"Dronarivm","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/1703766","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/dronarivm","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000032610649-98cvsv-large.jpg?3eddc42"},"label":{"id":1703766,"kind":"user","permalink":"dronarivm","username":"Dronarivm","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/1703766","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/dronarivm","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000032610649-98cvsv-large.jpg?3eddc42"},"permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/dronarivm/christoph-berg-coda","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000055699513-6lpo8k-large.jpg?3eddc42","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/3NUgbHJ8Fcv2_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106148636/stream?secret_token=","playback_count":2112,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":104,"comment_count":17,"likes_count":104,"reposts_count":16,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106148636/attachments","_resource_id":106148636,"_resource_type":"sound"}
